# simple-text-based-search-engine

In this project, expected to implement a hashing algorithm in Java to index words of documents given in X. The program must read these documents, split them word by word, and index each word to your hash table according to rules given below. After insertion of all documents, the user will query for a sentence that contains 3 words split by a single space. Your algorithm must bring the most relevant document for the query written by the user.

Hash function for converting a word to a key must be implemented by yourself. The value will be the word and the key will be returned by your hash function. The number of occurrences of each word also must be stored as count value for each document separately. 

Simple Summation Function (SSF)

You can generate the hash code of a string s with the length n simply by the following formula:

Polynomial Accumulation Function (PAF)

The hash code of a string s can also be generated by using the following polynomial:

Linear Probing (LP)
Linear probing handles collisions by placing the colliding item in the next (circularly) available table cell.

Double Hashing (DH)
Double hashing uses a secondary hash function d(k) and handles collisions by placing an item in the first available cell of the series.
